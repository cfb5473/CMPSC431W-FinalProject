README for CMPSC 431W Final Project
This CLI (Command-Line Interface) application is designed to manage a PostgreSQL database for a system that handles laptop specifications and product details. Each function within the CLI provides a specific operation for interacting with the database, allowing users to insert, delete, update, search, and perform various other data manipulations.

Below is a description of the functions within the CLI programming:

connect_to_db()
Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using given credentials. It returns a connection object if successful, or None if an error occurs.

insert_data(conn, table_name)
Allows users to insert new records into a specified table. Depending on the table selected, the function will prompt the user for the relevant data needed to create a new record within the table.

delete_data(conn)
Removes a record from the laptop table based on a model name provided by the user. This function will delete the record if it exists.

update_data(conn)
Updates details of a laptop record based on the model name. The user can specify which attribute to update and the new value for that attribute. (Model name must be specific as a general name would be unsafe and not promote the integrity of the data.) 

            --Example
                       Deleting data with the model name "mac" where multiple records could have "mac" in their model name such as "Macbook Pro, iMac, etc". Thus a specific model name must be entered.

search_data(conn)
Enables users to find records in the database based on certain criteria. Users can search for laptop models or products by brand name.

aggregate_functions(conn, table_name)
Performs aggregate calculations, such as sum, average, count, minimum, and maximum, on a specified column within a table. It will prompt the user for the type of aggregation and the column to perform it on.

sorting(conn, table_name)
Sorts the results of a query based on a specified column. Users can choose the column and order (ASC or DESC) for sorting.

joins(conn)
Combines data from multiple tables using relationships defined between them. Users can perform inner, left, or right joins by specifying the tables and the type of join.

grouping(conn, table_name)
Groups query results based on a specified column. This function will prompt the user for the column to group by.

subqueries(conn, table_name)
Supports nested operations within queries, allowing for explicit data retrieval.

transactions(conn)
Handles transactions to ensure the consistency and reliability of database operations. It includes functionality for applying discounts to laptop prices and ensures changes are committed or rolled back appropriately.

table_operations(conn, table_name)
Acts as the central hub for interacting with specific tables. It loops through options allowing users to choose which operation to perform on the selected table.

main()
The entry point of the CLI application. It initiates a connection to the database and presents a menu for the user to choose which table to operate on or exit the program.

Each function is designed with error handling to ensure that any issues during the operation do not affect the stability of the database and are communicated clearly to the user.
